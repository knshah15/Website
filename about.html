                    <div class="maintextbottommargin_au">
                        <p>My mission in founding Skill Seeker is to provide affordable training to people in the community who wish to increase their skills in the software applications most every business uses. My approach is to understand your personal goals and budget. From there, I will create a curriculum that fits your needs. For example, if you are entering a career that requires data analysis but have never used Excel, I will create exercises and examples that will get you to your goal quickly.</p>
                        <p>Currently, my training is done one-on-one at your home or a location that is mutually convenient. I believe the best way to learn is to have someone beside you explaining concepts and taking the time to understand how you learn best. Whether you are a student, transitioning to a new career, or running your own business, I will train you to use Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and other programs, so that you can achieve whatever goal you have.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I want to share the success I have had in my career getting interviews and getting jobs. I will work with you to create a strong resume and cover letter that will separate you from other applicants. When it comes time to the interview, I'll coach you and conduct mock interviews so that you are prepared for whatever they may throw at you.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to working with you!</p>

                            <p>I worked in the corporate world for 10 years in multiple industries and roles - from banking to software programming to digital marketing. In those 10 years I realized that no matter which company I was a part of, there were core skills that enabled me to perform strongly in whatever role I had.</p>
                            <p>I have a passion for teaching, coaching and speaking. I decided to start Skiller Seeker to pursue these passions, and share the skills that brought me success in an affordable and efficient way.</p>
                            <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in Economics at Rice University and later studied programming at Columbia University.</p>
                            <p>I am located in Morris Plains, NJ.</p>
